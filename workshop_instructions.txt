1. Setup test server
  To test our soapui addons we need something to test against.
  Here json-server is a great help for installing a REST-server locally.
  Json-server is fast and simple to control output from.
   - On windows you need to install node-js + npm first, see http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows
  Download and follow instructions from: https://github.com/typicode/json-server
  - On windows your json-server will be installed in the Roaming directory of your current user
  - In my case this was: C:\Users\Anders\AppData\Roaming\npm
  - You now need to add this directory to your PATH environment variable (or use full pathname when starting json-server)
  - setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Users\Anders\AppData\Roaming\npm"
  - !! NB !! PATH can  only be 1024 characters, watch so you dont get 'truncated warning'
    + Then you have to edit in registry directly, see http://superuser.com/questions/387619/overcoming-the-1024-character-limit-with-setx

2. Install latest SoapUI (curerntly 5.2), see http://www.soapui.org/

3. Install Git, if you don't already have it installed. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

4. Clone this repo to your pc. Se options on rigth side of the github page.
 - Or open cmd (gitshell or powershell), go to directory where you want your repo to be placed and give cmd:
 - git clone https://github.com/andekd/test-soapuitools.git . (dont forgett the last dot '.' in the cmd)

5. If you want to build the jar-file you need to have maven installed. https://maven.apache.org/install.html
   Otherwise the latest checked in jar is available in /soapuiutil/target

6. Copy the soapuiutil-0.0.1.jar file to your soapui's installation-lib folder, in my case:
   C:\Program Files\SmartBear\SoapUI-5.2.0\lib.

7. Get java api for reading excel-files from http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven/net.sourceforge.jexcelapi/jars/jxl-2.6.jar
   Anv copy it to soapui's installation-lib folder.
   !! NB !! Dont forget to restart Soapui (if you had it started already), to read the newly copied api

8   Start json-server with javascript users.js, you will find this under the folder 'external' in your newly cloned git-repo.
    Start cmd: json-server users.js

9.  Start Soapui, create new projet/testsuit/testcase. In the new testcase create a script teststep. Disable this step, only used for testcase population.
    Add following groovy code to your script:
    
    import se.cag.test.soapui.DataDrivenTestsUtil
    DataDrivenTestsUtil myDdUtil = new DataDrivenTestsUtil (log, testRunner, context)
    myDdUtil.create1DTestSteps(testRunner.testCase, "Users.xls")

10. Save your testcase. In the folder where you saved the testcase copy the testdata excelfile from /target/Users.xls.
    (Has to be excel97 format, otherwise soapui can't read it).

11. In Soapui run your newly created groovy script (just click ok in the http request step popup). The testcase will now be populated with several teststeps.

12. Add endpoint "http://localhost:3000/users/${#TestCase#value}" to the 'MyHttpReq' and save the testcase

13. The testcase should now be runable. Dubble-click on testcase to get testcase window open and click run.

14. Appropriate assertions must be added to the 'MyHttpReq' otherwise this is it.
